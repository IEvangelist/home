    <h1>📋 Streaming Checklist</h1>
    <p>
        Regardless of whether you're streaming live, or recording — this checklist can help to ensure you'll have the best possible streaming experience. Before you "go live" or "press record", consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="list no-bullets p-0 pt-1">
        @foreach (var task in _tasks)
        {
            <li>
                <SessionCheckBox Item=@(new TaskItem(task)) />
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
</div>

@code {
    readonly string[] _tasks = new[]
    {
        "🎙️ Use a dedicated microphone if possible",
